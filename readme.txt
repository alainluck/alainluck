- ✌🏻 Hi, I’m Alain
- I recently finished my masters in middle eastern studies and history. To keep my brain working during summer I started to learn web development.
- Currently I am doing a UDEMY bootcamp on html/css/js. My first goal will be to change my website from wordpress to something self built. 
- My other interest are photography & videography, degrowth, vanlife and alternative lifestyles, sports & other outdoor activities.
- you can find more on myself on my website (still on wordpress for now 🙈): https://alainluck.ch
